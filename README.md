# Explosive Enhancement (NeoForge)

An unofficial NeoForge port of the original Explosive Enhancement mod, which enhances Minecraft explosions with stunning particle effects and customizable options.

## Features

Explosive Enhancement is a simple mod that makes explosions look better. It adds many new particles, any of which you can enable/disable at will. You can also completely enable/disable the mod via the config too!

There is also a special underwater explosion effect for when an explosion occurs underwater. You can make it so that there are lots of bubbles during an underwater explosion for a very satisfying effect!
